# Fibbonaci-Programs_2
This is a Collection of Fibonacci Programs in many many languages such as Python, PHP, C#, and my goal is to make a BASIC program that will be the starting up program of Quantum-OS. All you do in run the programs in Jetbrains Pycharm Community Editon preferably, and then the result will just pop up on the screen. And note that Intelligi Idea a=can also be used due to the fact hat there is a variety of langauegs. The different languages te program is written in follow below:
* Python
* C, C++, C#
* Golang, Dart
* Swift and Java
* Javascript, Typescript
* Shell, Perl, Raku
* PHP and Ruby

## Examples for runnig the programs
So let us first open up an IDE or an online editor such as Repl.it that supports this langauge (Reasearch on your own). Then insert the code into the IDE like the following java program below:

```java
class fibonacci
{
    static int fib(int n)
    {
    if (n <= 1)
       return n;
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
    }
      
    public static void main (String args[])
    {
    int n = 9;
    System.out.println(fib(n));
    }
}
```

Then you press run and the code should appear on the languages shell. Then you are done!
